# The null Community

This repository is intended to contain hands-on training content specifically for conducting null Humla/Puliya sessions in various null chapters across India. 

Keeping in mind the repeated demand for the same training content again and again, but for a newer audience, we are creating this repository. Anyone is free to enhance the existing content and/or use the training material provided here to deliver a null Humla/Puliya session in any of the null communities across India.

At this time, only information for Android is available.
